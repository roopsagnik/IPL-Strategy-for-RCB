# üèè IPL 2017 Mega Auction Strategy ‚Äì RCB Player Selection

## üìò Project Overview :
In this project, I worked as a sports data analyst for **Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)** to support their decision-making process ahead of the **2017 IPL mega auction**.  
The objective was to identify **top-performing**, **consistent**, and **cost-effective players** by analyzing historical IPL data. All analysis was conducted using **SQL** for data extraction from a multi-table database, and **Excel** for organizing, cleaning, and interpreting the results.  
The focus was on generating **actionable, data-driven insights** to optimize player selection and auction investments.
